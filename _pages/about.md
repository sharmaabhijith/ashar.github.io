Hi Folks! I am a Ph.D. student at the intersection of multimodal AI, human-computer interaction, and fairness in the [Artificial Intelligence](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/ai-degree-program) and [Computer Science](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/academics/graduate/cs) programs at Oregon State University, where I'm advised by [Stefan Lee](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~leestef/) (and [Minsuk Kahng](https://minsuk.com/) before his relocation to Google).

My research evaluates large-scale vision-language models like CLIP, ViLBERT, LLaVA, and DALL-E. I enjoy auditing the real-world steps to get these models in production and determining mitigations to help promote fair outcomes. Frequently, this leads to human-centered methods that consider the entire lifecycle of a model: from data collection to deployment.

In addition to research, I am also the Co-President of OSU's [AI Graduate Student Association](https://www.aigsa.club/), where I organize social and professional events for our AI community and run the [AI Application Support Program](https://www.aigsa.club/aiasp/) to provide application advising assistance to underrepresented people applying to graduate school.
